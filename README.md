## Abstract

There's this thing, COVID, that we don't like. We don't really know much about how it affects people. We should really look into that.

<br/>

## Introduction

COVID is bad. Here's data. Let's see if a p<.05 falls out if we shake the data hard enough.

<br/>

## Hypotheses

It could be hypothesized that [independent variable] is [sign] correlated with Per Capita COVID Deaths.
