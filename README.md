## Abstract

Racial disparity in health, demographic, and COVID data was examined. Analyses revealed significant correlations between pneumonia vaccination and per capita COVID deaths, as well as population density and per capita COVID deaths. The non-White population was found to be significantly over-represented among COVID deaths, with rates of pneumonia vaccination and urban living likely contributing to the disparity.

## Introduction

This report is a data analysis investigation into racial disparity in deaths from COVID-19 in the United States, and the effects of certain health and demographic factors.

NOTE: Throughout the report the population is separated into two groups, “non-Hispanic White only”, and “not Non-Hispanic White only”, based on Census categories. For lack of a more feasible racially-sensitive construct, these will be referred to as “White” and “non-White”, respectively. Any analyses including “Hispanic Whites” in “White”, or not limiting to “White only”, or using any other racial groupings, could reach different, equally-valid conclusions.

## Hypotheses

1. There is racial disparity in COVID deaths in America

2. Any racial disparity will not be affected by age group

3. The sex and/or party of a State’s Governor has an effect on racial disparity in COVID deaths.

4. There are differences in health factors and outcomes by racial group

5. Some health factors contribute to COVID deaths

6. Per capita COVID deaths scale with measures of population density

## Datasets Used

* CDC Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Weekly State-Specific Data Updates
* CDC Daily Updates of Totals by Week and State Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
* CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2018
* Census QuickFacts New York
* Census Annual State Resident Population Estimates for 6 Race Groups (5 Race Alone Groups and Two or More Races) by Age, Sex, and Hispanic Origin
* Wikipedia List of United States governors

## Description of Analyses

The Racial Disparity Index (RDI) was created, an ad hoc measure quantifying the ratio between per capita COVID deaths and expected per capita COVID deaths for the non-White population.

The RDI was determined across states, Census regions, age groups, in various groupings.

Plots and ANOVAs compared political information with RDIs.

Health data focusing on respiratory factors were compared between racial groups.

The effect of pneumonia vaccination and asthma on per capita COVID deaths was investigated.

Demographic data focusing on population density were compared between racial groups.

The effect of several measures of population density on per capita COVID deaths was investigated.

## Conclusions

* There is racial disparity in COVID deaths.

* Age is not a factor in racial disparity in COVID deaths.

* Political factors do not contribute to racial disparity in COVID deaths.

* There are significant differences in health and demographic variables between racial groups.

* Some of those health factors contribute to differences in COVID deaths.

* Population density is a significant predictor of
