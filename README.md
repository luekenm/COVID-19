## Abstract

There's this thing, COVID, that we don't like. We don't really know much about how it affects people. We should really look into that.

<br/>

## Introduction

COVID is bad. Here's data. Let's see if a p<.05 falls out if we shake the data hard enough.

<br/>

## Hypothetical Hypotheses

It could be hypothesized that [independent variable] is [sign] correlated with [dependent variable].

Hypotheses 1a - 27e = 135 total guesses given currently imported datasets. More hypotheses to be added, and even more to be removed. [Author's Note: It should be added (and apologized for) that the present study's author is a Psych Minor.]

<br/>

## **Actual** Hypotheses

* (Per capita COVID Deaths) will be significantly higher in (non-white populations) vs (white populations).

* (Per capita COVID Deaths) will be significantly higher in regions with higher (obesity prevalence), (poverty) and (basal unemployment), and lower in regions with higher (access to health care) and (basal general good health).

* (Elapsed time since peak of seven day average daily new COVID cases) will positively correlate with (mandatory mask orders), and negatively with (time since lockdown measures lifted).

## Datasets Used

* BRFSS LLCP 2018
* NHANES 2015-2016
* Harvard Dataverse
* Wikipedia List of US Governors
* FEC 2016 Election Results
* Google
* Pew Religious Landscape Survey
* Whole Foods Store Finder

<br/>

## Description of Analyses

Lots of ANOVAs, and some graphs of the interesting bits.
