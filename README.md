## Abstract

There's this thing, COVID, that we don't like. We don't really know much about how it affects people. We should really look into that.

<br/>

## Introduction

COVID is bad. Here's data. Let's see if a p<.05 falls out if we shake the data hard enough.

<br/>

## Hypothetical Hypotheses

It could be hypothesized that [independent variable] is [sign] correlated with Per Capita COVID Deaths.

Hypotheses 1a - 4b = 19total guesses given currently imported datasets. More hypotheses to be added, and even more to be removed. [Author's Note: It should be added (and apologized for) that the present study's author is a Psych Minor.]

## **Actual** Hypotheses

* (Per capita COVID Deaths) will be significantly higher in (non-white populations) vs (white populations).

* (Per capita COVID Deaths) will be significantly higher in regions with higher (obesity prevalence), (poverty) and (basal unemployment), and lower in regions with higher (access to health care) and (basal general good health).

* (Elapsed time since peak of seven day average daily new COVID cases) will positively correlate with (mandatory mask orders), and negatively with (time since lockdown measures lifted).
